              CopySlice Utility v0.1 for RomWbW computers
                   written by Mark Pruden (Sept 2024)
==========================================================================

Purpose:
--------

The purpose of this utility is to allow the copying of whole disk slices
from one disk slice to another slice

Background
----------

This tool is only supported by RomWBW HBIOS, it uses HDIOS for all its 
disk IO. UNA UBIOS is not supported by this tool. 

This tool only works with hard disk devices, other media types like 
floppy, are not supported at this time. This tool works across different 
hard disk device types, even of different physical type

Both hd1k and hd512 are fully supported, however copying from one layout 
type to the other is not supported.

During operation data is copied in a single read/write pass, noting data 
is not verified by a re-read. If there is a write error, it will be reported, 
and operation will stop.

General Usage
-------------
This tool operates at the disk level via RomWBW, thus all disk identifiers 
are in the RomWBW <disk>.<unit> format

The syntax (similar to copy) for the command is:

  COPYSL <destunit>[.<slice>]=<srcunit>[.<slice>] [/options]
  
E.g.
  
  COPYSL 3.3=2.10 /U

Means copy from slice 10 on disk 2, onto disk 3 slice 3. Tis is in unattended
mode, so you will not be asked to confirm the copy operation.

Options
-------
U - Unattended. Will complete copy without confirmation from the user
F - Full disk copy. Copies the complete disk slice, all sectors.

Description
-----------

When run COPYSL will perform command line argument validation and display 
an error if they are illegal. Also any disk IO errors will cause COPYSL to exit.

When specifying slice number(s) a check is made that the slice number is valid,
i.e. not too large that it would extend past the end of the partition (hd1k), 
or the end of the media (hd512). For hd512 a check is also performed to 
ensure that the slice would not extend into the first defined partition.

The copy operation will be faster if the source disk has been formatted with 
the CP/M file system, since during copy the CP/M directory is scanned, and 
unused blocks are not copied. 

If a filesystem is not found, (or the /F option is chosen) all data is copied.

During copy dots "." will be displayed to indicate progress of the copy.
Each "." represents 16 kBytes of data copied. Each line of "." 's is 1 mBytes.

Testing
-------
This tool has been tested on both SD and CF media types and with hd1k and hd512
formatted media

Future
------
* support a verify option to read/verify data just written
